It’s located just off Lehi’s historic Main Street. I had always seen the sign on I-15 telling me that I could exit now to go to the museum, but had never visited. Now that we have been, I am really looking forward to going back! We were all fascinated (even the two-year-old) by the different collections that they had on display. Plus, like all great museums, they have hands-on activities for the little ones! Total win-win in my book! The kids can enjoy themselves, while the adults enjoy themselves.<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-230\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/John-Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-190x300.jpg\" alt=\"john-hutchings-museum-lehi\" width=\"190\" height=\"300\" /><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-228 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-UT-97-e1478221828919-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"hutchings-museum-lehi-ut-97\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-232\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/John-Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-Utah-6-240x300.jpg\" alt=\"john-hutchings-museum-lehi-utah-6\" width=\"240\" height=\"300\" /><p>The museum is named after John Hutchings who was an avid collector of pretty much everything. Between his personal collection and things that others have since donated, the museum has so much to see and enjoy!<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-234\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/John-Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-Utah-4-300x283.jpg\" alt=\"john-hutchings-museum-lehi-utah-4\" width=\"300\" height=\"283\" /><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-241\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/John-Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-Utah-7-300x275.jpg\" alt=\"john-hutchings-museum-lehi-utah-7\" width=\"309\" height=\"283\" /><p>The different areas you can visit include: Butterfly &amp; Insect Hall, Rock &amp; Mineral Room, Dinosaur &amp; Fossil Room, Pioneer Room, Early 1900’s Textiles Room, Early Entertainment Room, Wild West Room, Lehi’s Old West &amp; Jail Room, Bird &amp; Animal Room, and a Native American Room.<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-236\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/John-Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-Utah-1-300x187.jpg\" alt=\"john-hutchings-museum-lehi-utah-1\" width=\"311\" height=\"194\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-240\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/John-Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-Utah-2-300x194.jpg\" alt=\"john-hutchings-museum-lehi-utah-2\" width=\"300\" height=\"194\" /><p>Fun fact: when you visit the “Old West &amp; Jail Room,” note that it was an actual jail that was in use until the 1980’s!<p><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-233 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-UT-148-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"hutchings-museum-lehi-ut-148\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><p>I think if you love history, you would probably ‘geek out’ at the Hutchings Museum. I am not a total history fanatic (like my husband) but while I was there, I felt like one! Everything we saw had me in awe, and I wanted to learn and know and see more of it all!<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-237 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-UT-145-e1478236888925-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"hutchings-museum-lehi-ut-145\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-238\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/John-Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-Utah-5-264x300.jpg\" alt=\"john-hutchings-museum-lehi-utah-5\" width=\"264\" height=\"300\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-243\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/John-Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-Utah-9-259x300.jpg\" alt=\"john-hutchings-museum-lehi-utah-9\" width=\"259\" height=\"300\" /><p>Every area was a whole new experience as it focused on something new and different than what we had previously seen!<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-239 aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-UT-248-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"hutchings-museum-lehi-ut-248\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><p>I think it would have been fascinating to hear John Hutchings tell stories about his collections first-hand. I am sad I missed out on that but very glad that the museum is here to visit and enjoy! If you haven’t been, I would definitely make time to go. Go learn about olden day Lehi, the Pioneers, Native Americans, or walk around the other exhibits. You can do it all. There is a lot packed into this museum, I think you will be pleasantly surprised!<p><img class=\"wp-image-244 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Hutchings-Museum-Lehi-UT-118-e1478238194244-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"hutchings-museum-lehi-ut-118\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /><p>Admission<p>Adults: $4\nChildren (3-12): $3\nStudents (13-18): $3\nSenior Citizens: $3\nFamilies (up to 6 people): $12<p>Address: 55 North Center Street Lehi, UT 84043<p>Hours: Tuesday-Saturday 11:00am-5:00pm (Closed Holidays)<p>Website: John Hutchings Museum Natural &amp; Cultural History\n(<a href=\"https://www.lehi-ut.gov/recreation/museum/\">https://www.lehi-ut.gov/recreation/museum/</a>)",

            "content": "If you love Christmas lights, you most definitely need to check out Christmas in Color. It was introduced to Utah last year, and I think a lot of visitors, like ourselves, have decided to make it an annual tradition! We had seen the Christmas in Color Drive Thru Light Display in Kearns all over the news and social media and decided we should probably check it out for ourselves. Worth it? Totally! It was so cool, not like any other light display we had ever been to before, and just so much fun for the kids too. We knew it would be a hit, so we loaded up our car to full capacity and took some extra kids with us, and you can bet that they all left begging to go through just one more time.<p>We went on a Saturday (at 9pm), I am convinced that was the busiest time for us to choose, but it wasn't a bad wait. Maybe 10 minutes to get inside the actual light display, and it took us 30 minutes to drive the 1 mile long light display (but it didn't seem like it). When we left, there was no line to get in, drastic difference from 30 minutes prior. But like I said, the wait wasn't bad at all. The kids enjoyed spying on the lights that they could see while we waited.<p>15 second video clips:<p>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vy8psoxBrO0&feature=youtu.be[/embed]<p>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF7JQJXwiBA&feature=youtu.be[/embed]<p>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjONql6tApE&feature=youtu.be[/embed]<p>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFg_rdaK0ZQ&feature=youtu.be[/embed]<p>The videos and photos just don't do it proper justice.

I got really excited and found as much information as I could, including the price tag. We were a little hesitant but after so much anticipation, we decided we would see if it is worth it. The answer: We will be setting aside money each year to go! I feel like it encompassed everything about Christmas. From the “holly jolly” to the “reason for the season.”<p><center><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-281 size-large\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0571-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"img_0571\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></center>We have two littles so we booked our tickets for the earliest available time, bundled them up and were ready to go. All we knew was that Luminaria was an outdoor mile-long walk. Let me give you a little better idea for when you go. They have countless themed lighted areas that you walk through. Each one offering a different look and feel. I was surprised how many different moods they could create.<p><center><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-264\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0302-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"img_0302\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-265\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0378-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"img_0378\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-266\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0381-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"img_0381\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /> <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-267 size-large\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0419-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"img_0419\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></center>One of my favorite surprises of Luminaria was seeing that their new Light of the World Garden was complete! From previous visits, I knew it was a work in progress, but I didn’t know it had been completed. What a wonderful surprise to have it completed just in time for Christmas! It was so neat to walk around and reflect on Christ’s life as we celebrate his birth. Seeing the bronze sculptures with all the holiday lights surrounding each one really made us appreciate this season for it’s true meaning.<p><center><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-271 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0457-e1481068671471-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"img_0457\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-272 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0470-e1481068688760-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"img_0470\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /> <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-273 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0488-e1481068708843-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"img_0488\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /> <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-274 size-medium\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0490-e1481068724766-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"img_0490\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-275\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0497-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"img_0497\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /> <img class=\"alignnone wp-image-276 size-large\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0498-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"img_0498\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /></center>My daughter loved being able to visit a couple of Santa’s live reindeer that were also there enjoying the lights. Each time we walked around the corner and saw a different light display, she would eagerly say, “Look mom! More lights! Dad, look!” It was mesmerizing for us, but completely magical for her.<p><center><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-269\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0436-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"img_0436\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-270\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0442-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"img_0442\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-277\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0503-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"img_0503\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-278\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0509-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"img_0509\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-279\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0520-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"img_0520\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /> <img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-280\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_0558-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"img_0558\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></center>It truly is a one of a kind experience, and I loved being able to be outside walking around instead of sitting in a car (where some people have limited views at times).

We of course teased my oldest on the way there. She knew we were going to look at Christmas lights, and so as we drove past houses with Christmas lights up, we would say, \"Okay, we saw them, let's go home.\" She would excitedly yell, \"No!\" As we pulled up to the park, she screamed, \"There! Let's go there!\" and pointed to the lights in the distance. As we waited in line for them to check our ticket (which was not long at all), the kids climbed on my lap and the fun began. They were in awe over the lights, and it just got better and better. It seemed they had an unspoken staring contest to see who could go longer without blinking. Then as the shock wore off, they just cuddled together and watched the lights dance to the Christmas music. And that excitement and love is why I need this night etched into my memory forever.<p>I always want my husband to drive the truck and for us to sit in the back, just for the fun of it, but I love that with two young kids, we can enjoy the lights while staying warm inside the car.<p><img class=\"wp-image-296 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Christmas-in-Color-Provo-3-1024x410.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"410\" /><p>Christmas in Color is a timed event, so you select a 30 minute time frame and arrive sometime within the 30 minutes. You then tune into their designated radio station and enjoy the one million strands of dancing lights synchronized to the music. It's approximately a mile long, and took us about 20 minutes to drive through. We went on a Saturday night at 6:00 and there were only two cars ahead of us at the entrance gate, so for the wait time ... there basically was none.<p><img class=\"wp-image-299 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Christmas-in-Color-Provo-8-1024x516.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"516\" /><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-300 size-large\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Christmas-in-Color-Provo-10-1024x487.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"487\" /><p>Some video footage to give you a taste of what you can expect:<p>https://youtu.be/00mRKWM67XM<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>https://youtu.be/W_NiXA4dGqQ<p>&nbsp;<p>&nbsp;<p>https://youtu.be/_RuYanEkSug<p>Seriously though, can you believe there are millions and millions of Christmas lights?<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-307 size-large\" src=\"http://blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/IMG_7547-1024x577.jpg\" width=\"1024\" height=\"577\" /><p>I plan to keep this a family tradition for years to come!

I think it’s easy to forget because many of us have cupboards that are constantly stocked with perhaps, more than we need. But if we didn’t let ourselves forget that fact, what would we do to change it? Even Stevens founder and entrepreneur Steve Down wondered what a sandwich shop could do. “A team of foodies got involved, non-profits became partners, and what was just a big idea became a sandwich shop with a cause a place for real, sustainable change.” So here is how it works:\n<ul>\n \t<li>You buy a sandwich.</li>\n \t<li>At the end of every month, Evens Stevens tally sandwich sales. Funds for sandwich making ingredients bread, meat, cheese and produce -are then placed into a Sysco food account.</li>\n \t<li>Non-profit organizations access the account and order sandwich-making ingredients as they need. A few days later, a truck delivers the order to their doorstep. Free of charge</li>\n</ul>\nWhat’s awesome is that the way they have it set up, each non-profit organization has the ability to spend their funds according to their needs. What a wonderful gift. I absolutely love shops that have an underlying purpose!<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-344 size-large\" src=\"https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20170201011235im_/https://i1.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Even-Stevens-Sandiwch-Shop-Review-and-Giveaway-SLC-Utah-10-e1485033708893-768x1024.jpg?resize=768%2C1024\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Even-Stevens-Sandiwch-Shop-Review-and-Giveaway-SLC-Utah-10-e1485033708893.jpg?resize=768%2C1024 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Even-Stevens-Sandiwch-Shop-Review-and-Giveaway-SLC-Utah-10-e1485033708893.jpg?resize=225%2C300 225w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Even-Stevens-Sandiwch-Shop-Review-and-Giveaway-SLC-Utah-10-e1485033708893.jpg?resize=576%2C768 576w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Even-Stevens-Sandiwch-Shop-Review-and-Giveaway-SLC-Utah-10-e1485033708893.jpg?w=2000 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Even-Stevens-Sandiwch-Shop-Review-and-Giveaway-SLC-Utah-10-e1485033708893.jpg?w=3000 3000w\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p>So, let’s talk about their food. I have actually been craving it ever since we left. I tried their new Muffaletta sandwich. It is a sandwich designed by Even Stevens’ Chef Brandon specifically for their menu. The sandwich is meaty, it has mortadella, salami, ham and is topped with a provolone cheese. What makes the sandwich unique is the pickled vegetables you’ll find in it. The ciabatta bread all this yumminess is served on will only make you love it even more. It was created specifically for this sandwich and is made by a local bakery; Stone Ground Bakery which was founded here in Utah in 1902 (supporting local!). It’s a healthier vegan bread which is ironic when you think about how meaty this sandwich is. It was delicious. We went home and told our sitters that they needed to go in and try it – they did and loved it as well!<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-347 size-large\" src=\"https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20170201011235im_/https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Even-Stevens-Sandiwch-Shop-Review-and-Giveaway-SLC-Utah-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C768\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Even-Stevens-Sandiwch-Shop-Review-and-Giveaway-SLC-Utah-5.jpg?resize=1024%2C768 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Even-Stevens-Sandiwch-Shop-Review-and-Giveaway-SLC-Utah-5.jpg?resize=300%2C225 300w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Even-Stevens-Sandiwch-Shop-Review-and-Giveaway-SLC-Utah-5.jpg?resize=768%2C576 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Even-Stevens-Sandiwch-Shop-Review-and-Giveaway-SLC-Utah-5.jpg?w=2000 2000w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Even-Stevens-Sandiwch-Shop-Review-and-Giveaway-SLC-Utah-5.jpg?w=3000 3000w\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p>Even Stevens is a great option for any meal – date night, family dinners, lunch with coworkers and friends, it has something for everyone.

In each activity area, they had a lot of room and a lot of animals – making it easy for each kid to get a turn and to have as much time as they want.<p><img class=\"wp-image-355 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-6-e1489730961238-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><p>The only place where there was a 30 minute wait (literally, the lady actually chose me as the person she timed to see how long it took to get to the front) was the train ride. But of course, the kids can’t miss out on that! My daughter ended up riding it three times! (Oy vey – yes we waited in line each time). The horse rides didn’t even have a line (course that ride was a lot shorter). She did that three times too. She loved everything so much; it was very worth the visit.<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-362 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-2-300x169.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" />\n<p class=\"alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-359 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-1-e1489733775396-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p class=\"alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-371 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-17-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></p>\n<p class=\"alignnone\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-372 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-18-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></p>\nHighlights for her:<p>·       Holding baby chicks<p>·       Holding baby bunnies<p>·        Art (Coloring a Mother’s Day card of sheep)<p>·       Temporary Tattoos<p>·       Getting in the pen with a piglet, a turtle, and a ginormous rabbit<p>·       Bounce Houses<p>·       Riding the Horse (every kid gets 1 free ride with admission, additional $2 each)<p>·       Riding the Train (again, every kid gets 1 free ride with admission, each additional ride is $2 each)<p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-365 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-5-e1489733907991-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-364 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-4-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-366 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-10-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><p>They had the following show schedule:<p><b><u>Friday</u></b>\n3:00 PM Sheep Shearing Demo\n3:30 PM Wild Wonders Show\n4:30 PM Scales and Tails Show\n5:30 PM Sheep Shearing Demo\n6:30 PM Wild Wonders Show\n7:30 PM Scales and Tails Show<p><b><u>Saturday</u></b>\n11:00 AM Sheep Shearing Demo\n12:00 PM Scales and Tails Show\n1:00 PM Wild Wonders Show\n2:00 PM Sheep Shearing Demo\n3:00 PM Scales and Tails Show\n4:00 PM Wild Wonders Show<p>But randomly enough, we kept busy and didn’t make it to any of the shows. The only bathrooms were outhouses, which was tough because my little one was 5 days into potty training (but rocked it and didn’t have an accident). They also had some awesome food vendors. So you could easily take food in and picnic or enjoy some fantastic fair type food.<p>It’s only one weekend a year (2 days – Friday &amp; Saturday), but it is definitely worth the trip. Their website states that all proceeds from the event support 4-H programs and the botanical gardens. What great programs to support! It was approximately an hour drive each way for us, and I would do it again! My daughter loved it and now weeks later, she still asks if we can go back.<p><img class=\"wp-image-358 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-15-e1489733989716-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /><p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-369 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-13-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><p><img class=\"wp-image-368 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-12-e1489734029219-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-367 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-11-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><p><img class=\"wp-image-363 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-3-e1489734063153-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" /><p><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-361 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USU-Botanical-Gardens-Baby-Animal-Days-Kaysville-Utah-2-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" /><p>LOCATION:\nUtah State University Botanical Center\n875 South 50 West\nKaysville, UT 84037<p>2016 PRICES:\n$7 per person (3+)\n$35 for family up to 6\n(Military Family Pass $30)\n(Botanical Center/Gardens Member Pricing $25 Family, $5 Individual)\n*Proceeds from the event support 4-H programs and the botanical gardens.<p>You can visit their website here: <a href=\"http://www.babyanimaldays.org/\">http://www.babyanimaldays.org/</a><p>They did not give us free admission to this event for the review.

With a new baby and our growing family, my husband and I are always trying to find ways to bring our family closer and learn how to be the best teachers and examples that we can be for our children. It is difficult sometimes with this crazy world we live in, so when we find an activity that stands for goodness, we jump on it.<p>This year, we learned about the Alpine Easter Walk. We visited on the very last day that it was open and on my husband’s lunch break – so in the middle of the day. Guys, we were the ONLY ones there! I am not sure how busy it normally is, but this was perfect. I had no clue what to expect, and it took my breath away. <img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-399 size-large\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-3-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-3.jpg?resize=1024%2C683 1024w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-3.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-3.jpg?resize=768%2C512 768w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-3.jpg?w=2000 2000w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-3.jpg?w=3000 3000w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" /><p>There were signs lining the path that said, “Please Be Reverent.” My two-year-old was so excited to be out of the house, it was impossible to keep her reverent (hence why I was glad we were the only ones there). As we walked further up the path approaching the main area I kind of laughed to myself and thought, “This is going to be a joke.” They had music playing in the background, and as we got closer, the toddler craziness just disappeared, and I felt so peaceful and my heart was so full.<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-405 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-54-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-54.jpg?resize=1024%2C683 1024w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-54.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-54.jpg?resize=768%2C512 768w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-54.jpg?w=2000 2000w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-54.jpg?w=3000 3000w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" /><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-401 size-large\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-12-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/35.160.61.10/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-12.jpg?resize=1024%2C683 1024w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-12.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-12.jpg?resize=768%2C512 768w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-12.jpg?w=2000 2000w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-12.jpg?w=3000 3000w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" /><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-400 size-large\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-11-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-11.jpg?resize=1024%2C683 1024w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-11.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-11.jpg?resize=768%2C512 768w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-11.jpg?w=2000 2000w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-11.jpg?w=3000 3000w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" /><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-404 size-large\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-45-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-45.jpg?resize=1024%2C683 1024w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-45.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-45.jpg?resize=768%2C512 768w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-45.jpg?w=2000 2000w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-45.jpg?w=3000 3000w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" /><p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-403 size-large\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-33-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" srcset=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-33.jpg?resize=1024%2C683 1024w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-33.jpg?resize=300%2C200 300w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-33.jpg?resize=768%2C512 768w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-33.jpg?w=2000 2000w, http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-33.jpg?w=3000 3000w\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" /><p>I think everyone will get something different out of it. It gave us a teaching opportunity, it brought our family closer, and it allowed us to experience something new.

When I saw photos of Lantern Fest, I was in awe. I wondered, \"Could the real thing be as good as it looks?\" So we got tickets and decided to check it out! We attended Lantern Fest in Salt Lake City last week and guys – it is just as incredible as it looks!</p><p><center>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIPEhf4VQL0&feature=youtu.be[/embed]\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">The event begins at 3pm, there are bounce houses, princesses, live music, fire pits, s’mores, food trucks, outdoor games (like corn hole); everything you need to have a great time. My one piece of advice for Lantern Fest is: Go Early!! Make the most of it! Trust me, you won’t regret it. We decided that we would arrive at 6 pm, and apparently, we weren’t the only ones deciding to arrive at that time. We made pretty good time until we got 4 miles from the event location. It took us two hours to drive the last four miles and park. Guys, some people (even a bride and groom who were getting married that night at the event) never made it in. So, go on time! Go early. There is enough to do, that it is worth it!</p><p></center><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-342 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lantern-Fest-SLC-4-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Once we got inside of the gates, time flew by. We were having so much fun. There was plenty of room for everyone. So even though there was approx. 15,000 people in attendance, the space was so large, it didn’t feel like it. And let me tell you, the more the merrier, because at the end of the night – those 15,000 lanterns made for an epic show!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">So, once we parked, we walked to the gates and gave them our tickets. We picked up our lanterns and our Lantern Fest kits. Inside there was a lighter for lighting the lantern, a sharpie for decorating it, a s’more kit, a scavenger hunt, and then some information on Lantern Fest.</p><p><center>[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28gzAhvGYcA[/embed]<p>Right inside the gates they had princess meet-n-greets, face-painting, bounce houses, and a bungee trampoline. Since we had spent longer than planned in the car, we let our girls do the bounce houses to release some energy. Then my husband got in line at the food trucks.<p></center><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-336 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Lantern-Fest-SLC-1-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">You most definitely can't see the lanterns without meeting Rapunzel. We met Flynn Rider and Gothel too. The best part was that when Rapunzel sang, her hair really did light up!</p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-337 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Lantern-Fest-SLC-3-e1497588475639-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">Around dusk they started shutting all the activities down to prepare for the lantern send-off. We found a fire pit to sit by and listened to the live music while we prepped our lanterns.</p>\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-345 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lantern-Fest-SLC-7-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><img class=\"wp-image-346 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lantern-Fest-SLC-8-e1497589940705-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">They will tell you over the loud speakers when to start lighting them. They want everyone to do it at the same time, for the effect. And it’s worth it. It wasn't <em>as easy</em> as I expected it to be, but we picked up a couple extra lanterns (they have additional ones for sale), so by the end we were pretty much pros.</p>\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-351 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lantern-Fest-SLC-13-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /><p><img class=\"wp-image-352 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lantern-Fest-SLC-14-e1497590110442-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" />\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">FUN FACT: Lantern Fest Crew Members clean up the lanterns the following morning. If any are missing, they have a bar-code on them and Lantern Fest will donate to a charity.\nThe lanterns are made of rice paper, bamboo and string so they are biodegradable.\n<img class=\"wp-image-349 size-medium aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lantern-Fest-SLC-11-e1497590137337-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">It was an amazing night. A dream. I would go again in a heart-beat. I think everyone should go to <em>at least</em> once in their life, so if you haven’t been – check out the next one, coming to SLC in September! The Lantern Fest is held across the United States and often times, twice a year in the same location. We loved it. Our kids loved it. Our extended family that we met there loved it. We all recommend it and hopefully we will see you at the next one!</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-348 size-large\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lantern-Fest-SLC-10-e1497590175685-683x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"683\" height=\"1024\" /></p>\n<img class=\"wp-image-347 size-large aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lantern-Fest-SLC-9-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" /><p>To find out more about the next event, <a href=\"http://www.thelanternfest.com/\">check out the Lantern Fest website.</a><p>Admission: Varies on how far in advance you purchase tickets.

They were my favorite go-to shoe. They went with everything, looked adorable, and I knew were so comfy for her! As she grew, she still preferred her Freshly Picked moccasins over every other shoe type. She learned how to put them on by herself and would grab then as she headed to the door to go outside. She learned how to scooter with them, learned how to bike in them and has had many visits to the aquarium and zoo in them. They really have become a part of my memories of her growing up.\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-399\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Freshly-Picked-Doing-Utah-Daily-6-219x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"219\" height=\"300\" />\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-400\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Freshly-Picked-Doing-Utah-Daily-7-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" /></div>\n<div></div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-398 alignnone\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Freshly-Picked-Doing-Utah-Daily-5-218x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"218\" height=\"300\" /><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-396 alignnone\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Freshly-Picked-Doing-Utah-Daily-3-266x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"266\" height=\"300\" /></div>\n<div>Recently my second has been wearing the hand-me-down Freshly Picked moccasins. They have been well loved and are most-likely more comfortable because of it. I decided it was time to freshen up her closet and get her a pair of her own. So, we ordered her the Yvonne moccasin. Super cute and goes with just about everything in her closet! We are all in love. My little one will randomly bring them to me throughout the day so that I can put them on her, just because she loves wearing them. We get a kick out it.</div>\n<div style=\"display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: center;\"><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-397\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Freshly-Picked-Doing-Utah-Daily-4-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-394\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Freshly-Picked-Doing-Utah-Daily-1-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></div>\n<img class=\"size-medium wp-image-393 aligncenter\" src=\"http://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Freshly-Picked-Moccasins-by-doing-Utah-Daily-240x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"300\" /><p>Now that my oldest doesn’t fit in the moccasins, she’d rather go barefoot, but still begs on a daily basis for me to order more for her.

### **_Why seek ye the living among the dead?_** 

###  **_He is not here but has risen._**

This was seriously the best Easter ever. With a new baby and our growing family, my husband and I are always trying to find ways to bring our family closer and learn how to be the best teachers and examples that we can be for our children. It is difficult sometimes with this crazy world we live in, so when we find an activity that stands for goodness, we jump on it.

This year, we learned about the Alpine Easter Walk. We visited on the very last day that it was open and on my husband’s lunch break – so in the middle of the day. Guys, we were the ONLY ones there! I am not sure how busy it normally is, but this was perfect. I had no clue what to expect, and it took my breath away. ![](https://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-3-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)

There were signs lining the path that said, “Please Be Reverent.” My two-year-old was so excited to be out of the house, it was impossible to keep her reverent (hence why I was glad we were the only ones there). As we walked further up the path approaching the main area I kind of laughed to myself and thought, “This is going to be a joke.” They had music playing in the background, and as we got closer, the toddler craziness just disappeared, and I felt so peaceful and my heart was so full.![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Alpine-Easter-Walk-54-1024x683.jpg?resize=1024%2C683)

I think everyone will get something different out of it. It gave us a teaching opportunity, it brought our family closer, and it allowed us to experience something new. Something I hope we can do each year to remember the meaning of the holiday, and how it is so much more than the Easter Bunny.

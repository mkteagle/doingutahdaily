excerpt: 'Oh my goodness, it was the cutest and funnest thing they could have done. I loved their laughs and smiles throughout. That night while we were at home my husband was sitting on the floor doing a puzzle with the kid, and he exclaimed, "Oh my goodness, my feet have never been this soft before. We need to go back monthly!'

  Located inside the Layton Hills Mall, Seaquest Interactive Aquarium offers an
  amazing hands-on experience with marine life and more!

<Paragraph>
  My sister and her family gave my parents passes to SeaQuest Interactive
  Aquarium in Layton (just inside the Layton Hills Mall) for Christmas. After
  their visit they could not stop telling the rest of us about how much fun they
  had. So, we decided to plan a family day to visit the aquarium ourselves.

<H3>The Amazon Rainforest Experience</H3>

<Paragraph>
  The very first room we walked into was the Amazon Rainforest room. Every
  single room you walk into you are able to feed the animals. In this first
  room, you also have the opportunity to go into the Iguana habitat. It was so
  fun. You can feed them, touch them, or just look at them. They wander around
  so watch your feet and make sure you don't step on one!

<Paragraph>
  The next area that we walked into was the California Coast. This was one of my
  favorites. It had jelly fish, Axolotl’s and glow fish, red eyed tree frogs and
  so many more. Many of the creatures in this area glow under different
  spectrums of light.

<Paragraph>
  By the time we hit the second or third room, my husband was telling me how
  awesome this aquarium was. Really though, all I could do is agree with him.
  There is a tortoise that is allowed to wander the aquarium, habitats are open
  topped, or you can walk inside of them! It truly is a hands-on and interactive
  place!
</Paragraph>

<Paragraph>
  The aquarium uses tokens to purchase feedings as well as the fish spa and
  snorkel with the sting rays and a few other things. You can go into any
  habitat without paying, but if you want to feed the animals, it typically
  costs one token per feeding. We had ordered some tokens the same time we
  ordered our tickets and told our kids the different things that they could do
  when they got there and made a plan so that they knew they couldn’t ask to
  feed every single animal or do every single thing they saw.

<Paragraph>
  There are mermaids at the aquarium as well. They do glitter tattoos as well as
  swim around with the sting rays. They are only there during certain hours
  though, so we missed seeing them, but next time, we are looking forward to
  meeting one! Have you ever been to SeaQuest? Comment below and let us know
  what your favorite part was! And if you haven’t ever been, let us know if you
  have any questions! I wish we lived closer, and I would purchase a membership
  to take my kids on a regular basis. In the meantime we will just keep planning
  family days to go and visit! We hope that you have as much fun as we did!

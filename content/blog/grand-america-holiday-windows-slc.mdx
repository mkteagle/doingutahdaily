Christmas is never complete without a trip to Salt Lake where we participate in one of our most favorite (and FREE) Christmas activities - the Holiday Window stroll at the Grand America hotel. It is so much fun each and every year to see the beautiful displays that they create.

The theme this year (2015) was Christmas songs. So as you went to each window, you would figure out what Christmas song it represented and then write it down on the card they gave you.

Once your card is filled out, you can turn it in for a free Grand America cookie! Yummy!

As a bonus part of the stroll, you get to take in all of the Christmas decor around the hotel, which is incredible. One thing is for sure, and it is that they know how to do Christmas!

Each year the Grand America bakers create a kid sized Gingerbread house. Every year it is different also every year it is as festive and beautiful as a candy house can be!

This year the gingerbread house is based on the design of an old Wyoming homesteader cabin that was found at a ranch owned by Grand America.

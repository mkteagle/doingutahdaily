A few months ago as I was perusing the Thanksgiving Point website for upcoming activities and events I could take my kids to, I saw “Luminaria” pop up on my screen. I got really excited and found as much information as I could, including the price tag. We were a little hesitant but after so much anticipation, we decided we would see if it is worth it. The answer: We will be setting aside money each year to go! I feel like it encompassed everything about Christmas. From the “holly jolly” to the “reason for the season.”

We have two littles so we booked our tickets for the earliest available time, bundled them up and were ready to go. All we knew was that Luminaria was an outdoor mile-long walk. Let me give you a little better idea for when you go. They have countless themed lighted areas that you walk through. Each one offering a different look and feel. I was surprised how many different moods they could create.

One of my favorite surprises of Luminaria was seeing that their new Light of the World Garden was complete! From previous visits, I knew it was a work in progress, but I didn’t know it had been completed. What a wonderful surprise to have it completed just in time for Christmas! It was so neat to walk around and reflect on Christ’s life as we celebrate his birth. Seeing the bronze sculptures with all the holiday lights surrounding each one really made us appreciate this season for it’s true meaning.

My daughter loved being able to visit a couple of Santa’s live reindeer that were also there enjoying the lights. Each time we walked around the corner and saw a different light display, she would eagerly say, “Look mom! More lights! Dad, look!” It was mesmerizing for us, but completely magical for her.

It truly is a one of a kind experience, and I loved being able to be outside walking around instead of sitting in a car (where some people have limited views at times). We have all wanted to go back again and again since our visit.

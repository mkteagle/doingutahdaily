If you are wondering if Lantern Fest is worth it, or if it is as dream-like as it looks - the answer is YES! When I saw photos of Lantern Fest, I was in awe. I wondered, "Could the real thing be as good as it looks?" So we got tickets and decided to check it out! We attended Lantern Fest in Salt Lake City last week and guys – it is just as incredible as it looks!

The event begins at 3pm, there are bounce houses, princesses, live music, fire pits, s’mores, food trucks, outdoor games (like corn hole); everything you need to have a great time. My one piece of advice for Lantern Fest is: Go Early!! Make the most of it! Trust me, you won’t regret it. We decided that we would arrive at 6 pm, and apparently, we weren’t the only ones deciding to arrive at that time. We made pretty good time until we got 4 miles from the event location. It took us two hours to drive the last four miles and park. Guys, some people (even a bride and groom who were getting married that night at the event) never made it in. So, go on time! Go early. There is enough to do, that it is worth it!

Once we got inside of the gates, time flew by. We were having so much fun. There was plenty of room for everyone. So even though there was approx. 15,000 people in attendance, the space was so large, it didn’t feel like it. And let me tell you, the more the merrier, because at the end of the night – those 15,000 lanterns made for an epic show!

So, once we parked, we walked to the gates and gave them our tickets. We picked up our lanterns and our Lantern Fest kits. Inside there was a lighter for lighting the lantern, a sharpie for decorating it, a s’more kit, a scavenger hunt, and then some information on Lantern Fest.

Right inside the gates they had princess meet-n-greets, face-painting, bounce houses, and a bungee trampoline. Since we had spent longer than planned in the car, we let our girls do the bounce houses to release some energy. Then my husband got in line at the food trucks.

You most definitely can't see the lanterns without meeting Rapunzel. We met Flynn Rider and Gothel too. The best part was that when Rapunzel sang, her hair really did light up!

Around dusk they started shutting all the activities down to prepare for the lantern send-off. We found a fire pit to sit by and listened to the live music while we prepped our lanterns.

They will tell you over the loud speakers when to start lighting them. They want everyone to do it at the same time, for the effect. And it’s worth it. It wasn't _as easy_ as I expected it to be, but we picked up a couple extra lanterns (they have additional ones for sale), so by the end we were pretty much pros.

FUN FACT: Lantern Fest Crew Members clean up the lanterns the following morning. If any are missing, they have a bar-code on them and Lantern Fest will donate to a charity. The lanterns are made of rice paper, bamboo and string so they are biodegradable. ![](https://www.doingutahdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Lantern-Fest-SLC-11-e1497590137337-200x300.jpg)

It was an amazing night. A dream. I would go again in a heart-beat. I think everyone should go to _at least_ once in their life, so if you haven’t been – check out the next one, coming to SLC in September! The Lantern Fest is held across the United States and often times, twice a year in the same location. We loved it. Our kids loved it. Our extended family that we met there loved it. We all recommend it and hopefully we will see you at the next one!

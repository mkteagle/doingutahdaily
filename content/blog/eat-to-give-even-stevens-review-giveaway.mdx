My husband and I don’t get a lot of date nights, so when we do, we make sure that they are worthwhile! Last week we found a sitter and ventured to Sugar House and tried a place that we had heard about from so many good friends; Even Stevens: A Sandwich Shop With A Cause.

Let’s talk about their cause for a minute before delving into their food. 1 in 8 Americans are going hungry. I think it’s easy to forget because many of us have cupboards that are constantly stocked with perhaps, more than we need. But if we didn’t let ourselves forget that fact, what would we do to change it? Even Stevens founder and entrepreneur Steve Down wondered what a sandwich shop could do. “A team of foodies got involved, non-profits became partners, and what was just a big idea became a sandwich shop with a cause a place for real, sustainable change.” So here is how it works:

*   You buy a sandwich.
*   At the end of every month, Evens Stevens tally sandwich sales. Funds for sandwich making ingredients bread, meat, cheese and produce -are then placed into a Sysco food account.
*   Non-profit organizations access the account and order sandwich-making ingredients as they need. A few days later, a truck delivers the order to their doorstep. Free of charge

What’s awesome is that the way they have it set up, each non-profit organization has the ability to spend their funds according to their needs. What a wonderful gift. I absolutely love shops that have an underlying purpose!

So, let’s talk about their food. I have actually been craving it ever since we left. I tried their new Muffaletta sandwich. It is a sandwich designed by Even Stevens’ Chef Brandon specifically for their menu. The sandwich is meaty, it has mortadella, salami, ham and is topped with a provolone cheese. What makes the sandwich unique is the pickled vegetables you’ll find in it. The ciabatta bread all this yumminess is served on will only make you love it even more. It was created specifically for this sandwich and is made by a local bakery; Stone Ground Bakery which was founded here in Utah in 1902 (supporting local!). It’s a healthier vegan bread which is ironic when you think about how meaty this sandwich is. It was delicious. We went home and told our sitters that they needed to go in and try it – they did and loved it as well!

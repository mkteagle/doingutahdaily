Shortly after my first little one was born I ordered a pair of Freshly Picked moccasins. They were my favorite go-to shoe. They went with everything, looked adorable, and I knew were so comfy for her! As she grew, she still preferred her Freshly Picked moccasins over every other shoe type. She learned how to put them on by herself and would grab then as she headed to the door to go outside. She learned how to scooter with them, learned how to bike in them and has had many visits to the aquarium and zoo in them. They really have become a part of my memories of her growing up.

Recently my second has been wearing the hand-me-down Freshly Picked moccasins. They have been well loved and are most-likely more comfortable because of it. I decided it was time to freshen up her closet and get her a pair of her own. So, we ordered her the Yvonne moccasin. Super cute and goes with just about everything in her closet! We are all in love. My little one will randomly bring them to me throughout the day so that I can put them on her, just because she loves wearing them. We get a kick out it.

Now that my oldest doesn’t fit in the moccasins, she’d rather go barefoot, but still begs on a daily basis for me to order more for her. Who else has tried Freshly Picked moccs?

  We booked the Utah Tumbling Academy indoor instructor guided birthday party!
  Two hours of fun for the kids, and a low-stress party for mom!
</CalloutBox>

<Paragraph>
  My little one was so excited to plan her 5th birthday party. She wanted
  everything fairy and Tinker bell themed. Green with a little yellow and white.
  This was her first birthday party with friends, and it was fun watching her
  choose and create all the details, but most importantly, what they were going
  to do! She loves gymnastics and so when I told her the Utah Tumbling Academy
  lets people do birthday parties there, she was planning full speed ahead!

<H3>Working with Utah Tumbling Academy</H3>

<Paragraph>
  The Utah Tumbling Academy was great to work with. We emailed them throughout
  the planning, which is easier for me because phone calls with kids in the
  background... not so fun lol. We scheduled the party, arranged the type of
  party, and they answered all my birthday party questions with prompt replies,
  or within the next business day.

<Paragraph>
  We booked the birthday party **Package A** which included a Utah Tumbling
  Academy (UTA) Instructor to guide the party. I totally recommend this! The UTA
  instructor was so good with the kids and she kept them so busy. They went from
  activity to activity! They would run out to get drinks quick but then they
  were right back in the tumbling room playing! The laughter, smiles, and energy
  were nonstop!

<Paragraph>
  They have a party room which has a window into the tumbling room. So, I was
  able to visit with the moms that decided to stay at the party, and it was
  quite relaxing for me too. Within the first 15 minutes the party instructor
  had several kids climbing on her and she just laughed and kept playing with
  them. Within the first 30 minutes she knew each one of them by name and would
  call out to them during play. That made it feel so special to not just have
  the kids be numbers, but to have them be seen and heard as the little people
  they are!

<H3>Party Packages</H3>

<Paragraph>
  The two-hour party that we booked had a 45-minute break in the middle of the
  play time. This was the perfect amount of time for a little lunch, gifts, and
  then cake and ice cream. Utah Tumbling Academy Salt Lake location has a
  fridge/freezer, sink and microwave, but the Draper location does not.

It’s baby animal time!!! If the warm weather of spring wasn’t good enough, we also get itty-bitty, soft and fuzzy, cute-as-can-be baby animals to go with it! There are a lot of great places to go to celebrate the start of spring and all the sweet babies, where is your favorite place?

Baby Animal Days at the USU Botanical Gardens in Kaysville, Utah was very impressive. Their baby animal days is only one weekend, a Friday and a Saturday. This year it was raining/sprinkling off and on, but we decided to chance it and were so glad we did. It didn’t rain while we were there, and it ended up being not very busy! It was so fun!

I was thrilled with the large space which allowed everything to be spread out and seem less busy. In each activity area, they had a lot of room and a lot of animals – making it easy for each kid to get a turn and to have as much time as they want.

The only place where there was a 30 minute wait (literally, the lady actually chose me as the person she timed to see how long it took to get to the front) was the train ride. But of course, the kids can’t miss out on that! My daughter ended up riding it three times! (Oy vey – yes we waited in line each time). The horse rides didn’t even have a line (course that ride was a lot shorter). She did that three times too. She loved everything so much; it was very worth the visit.

They had the following show schedule:

**Friday** 3:00 PM Sheep Shearing Demo 3:30 PM Wild Wonders Show 4:30 PM Scales and Tails Show 5:30 PM Sheep Shearing Demo 6:30 PM Wild Wonders Show 7:30 PM Scales and Tails Show

**Saturday** 11:00 AM Sheep Shearing Demo 12:00 PM Scales and Tails Show 1:00 PM Wild Wonders Show 2:00 PM Sheep Shearing Demo 3:00 PM Scales and Tails Show 4:00 PM Wild Wonders Show

But randomly enough, we kept busy and didn’t make it to any of the shows. The only bathrooms were outhouses, which was tough because my little one was 5 days into potty training (but rocked it and didn’t have an accident). They also had some awesome food vendors. So you could easily take food in and picnic or enjoy some fantastic fair type food.

It’s only one weekend a year (2 days – Friday & Saturday), but it is definitely worth the trip. Their website states that all proceeds from the event support 4-H programs and the botanical gardens. What great programs to support! It was approximately an hour drive each way for us, and I would do it again! My daughter loved it and now weeks later, she still asks if we can go back.

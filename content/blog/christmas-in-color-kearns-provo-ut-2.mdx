We made our second annual trip to the Christmas in Color lights this past weekend and I honestly never want to forget it.

Exhibit A:

The girls were enthralled with the magic of the lights. We of course teased my oldest on the way there. She knew we were going to look at Christmas lights, and so as we drove past houses with Christmas lights up, we would say, "Okay, we saw them, let's go home." She would excitedly yell, "No!" As we pulled up to the park, she screamed, "There! Let's go there!" and pointed to the lights in the distance. As we waited in line for them to check our ticket (which was not long at all), the kids climbed on my lap and the fun began. They were in awe over the lights, and it just got better and better. It seemed they had an unspoken staring contest to see who could go longer without blinking. Then as the shock wore off, they just cuddled together and watched the lights dance to the Christmas music. And that excitement and love is why I need this night etched into my memory forever.

I always want my husband to drive the truck and for us to sit in the back, just for the fun of it, but I love that with two young kids, we can enjoy the lights while staying warm inside the car.

Christmas in Color is a timed event, so you select a 30 minute time frame and arrive sometime within the 30 minutes. You then tune into their designated radio station and enjoy the one million strands of dancing lights synchronized to the music. It's approximately a mile long, and took us about 20 minutes to drive through. We went on a Saturday night at 6:00 and there were only two cars ahead of us at the entrance gate, so for the wait time ... there basically was none.

Seriously though, can you believe there are millions and millions of Christmas lights?

If you love Christmas lights, you most definitely need to check out Christmas in Color. It was introduced to Utah last year, and I think a lot of visitors, like ourselves, have decided to make it an annual tradition! We had seen the Christmas in Color Drive Thru Light Display in Kearns all over the news and social media and decided we should probably check it out for ourselves. Worth it? Totally! It was so cool, not like any other light display we had ever been to before, and just so much fun for the kids too. We knew it would be a hit, so we loaded up our car to full capacity and took some extra kids with us, and you can bet that they all left begging to go through just one more time.

We went on a Saturday (at 9pm), I am convinced that was the busiest time for us to choose, but it wasn't a bad wait. Maybe 10 minutes to get inside the actual light display, and it took us 30 minutes to drive the 1 mile long light display (but it didn't seem like it). When we left, there was no line to get in, drastic difference from 30 minutes prior. But like I said, the wait wasn't bad at all. The kids enjoyed spying on the lights that they could see while we waited.

The videos and photos just don't do it proper justice. It's definitely something you should check out for yourself!
